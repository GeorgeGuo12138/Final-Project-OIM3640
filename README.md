# Final Project
Angel Vargas and George Guo

# Amazon Price Tracker
The user is asked to input 1: an URL to an item on Amazon; 2: percent decrease in price that the user wishes to have, and; 3: the user's email address.
The application will automatically track the price of that item on Amazon and when the item's price drops by the user's desired percentage, an email is triggered and sent to the email address the user provided.
