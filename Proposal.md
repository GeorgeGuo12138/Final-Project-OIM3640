# The Big Idea
Our project will be an Amazon Price Tracker. Essentially, users can input any listed Amazon product, 
it will help track the price for any movements. 

# Learning Objectives
We have similar interests and goals, so we are working together. As a team, we want to implement the use 
of real-time data, such as price, and work with user input. We do want to try different objectives
## Angel: I want to create something I can use for future projects, such as stock prices and other website trackers.
## George: I want to learn to work with API and user inputs. I also want to build something that’s actually useful 
   using the knowledge we’ve learned in this course. If this project is successful, I will actually use our application 
   for shopping and I have a list of things to buy before I graduate.


# Implementation
There is already a video online that shows us this, however, the video is only for one object. We will create a function 
that requires the user to input the URL of the item. We will try to implement APIS such as Beautiful Soup

# Project Schedule
Every Week, we will meet at least once to work on the project. 
## Week 1: Individual work and understanding the video guide.
## Week 2: Change our code and try to test out different inputs. 
## Week 3: Create Presentation and Slides while one of us fixes the code. We coordinate together. 
## Week 4: Final Changes/updates and presentation. We will also work on adding extra features. 

# Collaboration Plan
Since we only have two people on the team, collaboration and communication should be easy and smooth between the two of us. 
Because we don’t know exactly what we are going to do for the project other than a big idea, we will collaborate using an 
agile approach. The plan is to meet weekly and assign individual work for the upcoming week. Once we are done with our individual 
parts, we can put them together or add them to the code with already have, and run it and do some debugging. Once everything is 
up and running, or once someone encounters big issues and cannot figure out how to debug, we get together and meet. Ideally each 
week serves as a progress check point for us. Additionally, we can choose to meet briefly after class on Tuesday and Thursday to 
go over the project briefly if we think it’s necessary. 

# Risk and Limitations
The biggest risk to the success of our project is the third party extension we use to get historical price information about items 
on Amazon. Of course Amazon won’t make this information public, so we have to rely on a third party we find on the internet. 
The reliability and usability of the third party we choose is the biggest piece of uncertainty and will directly impact the success 
of the project if it fails to work well.

# Additional Course Content
Historical information on a website, such as historical versions or changed contents, probably leave some trace that can be used 
for our project. If this is something that exists, we will probably find it helpful for our project.
